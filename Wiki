                </a> . It is scheduled to take place in Qatar from 21 November to 18 December 2022. This will be the
                first World Cup ever to be held in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world"> Arab world
                </a> ,<sup>[1]</sup> and it will be the second World Cup held entirely in Asia after the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup"> 2002 tournament </a> was held in South
                Korea and Japan.<sup>[a]</sup> In addition, the tournament will be the last to involve 32 teams, with an
                increase to 48 teams scheduled for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_FIFA_World_Cup"> 2026
                    tournament </a> in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The reigning World Cup champions are<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team"> France </a> .<sup>[2]</sup> Due
                to Qatar's intense summer heat, this World Cup will be held from late-November to mid-December, making
                it the first tournament not to be held in May, June, or July; it is to be played in a reduced timeframe
                of around 28 days.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
            <p>Accusations of corruption have been made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA
                internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing, but chief investigator <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Garcia"> Michael J. Garcia </a> has since described
                FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing "numerous materially incomplete and erroneous
                representations."<sup>[4]</sup> On 27 May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into
                corruption and money laundering related to the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_and_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_bids"> 2018 and 2022 World Cup
                    bids</a> .<sup>[5][6]</sup> On 6 August 2018, former FIFA president <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_Blatter"> Sepp Blatter </a> claimed that Qatar had used
                "black ops", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights.<sup>[7]</sup>
                Additionally, Qatar has faced strong criticism due to the treatment of foreign workers involved in
                preparation for the World Cup, with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">
                    Amnesty International </a> referring to "forced labour" and stating that hundreds or thousands of
                migrant workers have died as a result of human rights abuses, and careless and inhumane work
                conditions.<sup>[8]</sup></p>

                    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_and_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_bids">bidding procedure
                            to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups</a> began in January 2009, and
                        national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.<sup>[9]</sup>
                        Initially, eleven
                        bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from
                        proceedings,<sup>[10][11]</sup>
                        and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football
                        Association failed to submit a letter of <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Indonesia">Indonesian government </a>
                        guarantee to support the bid.<sup>[12]</sup>
                        Indonesian officials had not ruled out a bid for the 2026 <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_FIFA_World_Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>, until Qatar was
                        awarded the 2022 tournament.[citation needed] During the bidding process, all non-UEFA nations
                        gradually withdrew their 2018 bids, thus guaranteeing that a <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA">UEFA </a>nation would host the 2018
                        tournament and thereby making UEFA nations ineligible for the 2022 bid.[citation needed]

In the end, there were five bids for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South
Korea, and the United States. The twenty-two member Committee convened in <a
                         href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>
                        on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<sup>[13]</sup> Two <a

                            committee </a> members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of
                        corruption
                        regarding their votes.<sup>[14]</sup> The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which
                        was graded as
                        having "high operational risk",<sup>[15]</sup> generated criticism from media commentators.[16]
                        It has been
                        criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals.<sup>[16]</sup>

                        There have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving FIFA's
                        executive committee members. These allegations are being investigated by FIFA (<em>see</em> <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Bidding_corruption_allegations">
                            <em>§ Bidding
                                corruption allegations</em></a>, <em>below)</em>.

Qatar is the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup – the next
smallest by area is Switzerland, host of the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_FIFA_World_Cup">1954 FIFA World Cup</a>, which is
                        more than three times
                        as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of the current 32.

Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay, as hosts of the first-ever
                        World Cup) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition.
Japan was previously awarded co-hosting rights of the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a> alongside
                        South Korea
                        without ever having qualified for the finals, although they subsequently qualified for the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_FIFA_World_Cup">1998
                            FIFA World Cup</a>.

Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former CIA
                        officer turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football
                        officials who picked the winner in 2010.<sup>[19]</sup>

                    <p>
                        On 12 April 2018, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL">CONMEBOL </a> requested that
                        FIFA expand the 2022 FIFA World Cup from 32 to 48
                        teams, four years before the 2026 FIFA World Cup as initially planned.[<sup>[20][21]</sup> <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_FIFA">FIFA President
                            Gianni Infantino</a> expressed willingness to consider the request.<sup>[22]</sup> However,
                        the FIFA congress
                        rejected the request shortly before the beginning of the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup">2018 FIFA World Cup</a>. Infantino
                        said the
                        global football governing body would not discuss the possibility of having a 48-team World Cup,
                        and that they would first discuss the matter with the host country.<sup>[23]</sup>

In March 2019, a "FIFA feasibility study" concluded that it was possible to expand the
                        tournament to 48 teams, albeit with the assistance of "one or more" neighbouring countries and
                        "two to four additional venues." FIFA also said that "while it cannot rule out legal action from
                        losing bidders by changing the format [of the tournament], the study said it 'concluded that the
                        risk was low'." FIFA and Qatar would have explored possible joint proposals to submit to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Council">FIFA Council</a> and the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Congress">FIFA Congress</a> later in June. Had a
                        joint proposal been submitted, FIFA's
                        member associations would have voted on the final decision at the 69th FIFA Congress in <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</a>,
                        France, by 5 June.<sup>[24][25]</sup> However, on 22 May, FIFA announced it would not expand the
                        tournament.<sup>[26]</sup>

The allocation of slots for each confederation was discussed by the FIFA Executive Committee on

                        2006, which remained unchanged for 2010, 2014, and 2018, would continue for the 2022

                    A qualifying draw was scheduled to take place in July 2019; this was later cancelled to allow each
                    confederation to hold their own draws for their individual qualifying tournaments.[32] The first
                    qualifying matches were played in June 2019 in the Asian qualifying tournament, with <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia_national_football_team">Mongolia</a> defeating <a

                    which Mongolian player Norjmoogiin Tsedenbal scored the first goal of qualifying.<sup>[33]</sup>

Due to concerns about the heat, leading football clubs in Europe wanted the World Cup to take place
                    from 28 April to 29 May rather than the typical June and July staging.<sup>[34]</sup>
